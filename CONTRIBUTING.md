# Contributing to Fast JSON API

We are following the Gitflow workflow. The active development branch is [dev](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi/tree/dev), the stable branch is [master](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi/tree/master).

Contributions will be accepted to the [dev](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi/tree/dev) only.

## How to provide a patch for a new feature

1. If it is a major feature, please create an [Issue]( https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi/issues ) and discuss with the project leaders.

2. If in step 1 you get an acknowledge from the project leaders, use the
   following procedure to submit a patch:

    a. Fork Fast JSON API on github ( http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ )

    b. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)

    c. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)

    d. Initiate a pull request on github ( http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ )

    e. Done :)

3. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate

For minor fixes just open a pull request to the [dev]( https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi/tree/dev ) branch on Github.
